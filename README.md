Solution 1
The jobs, after sorting based on their service times using the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm, are scheduled as follows:

Job 1 with service time 3
Job 2 with service time 4
Job 5 with service time 7
Job 10 with service time 8
The waiting times for each job are:

Job 1: 0 units
Job 2: 3 units
Job 5: 7 units
Job 10: 14 units

Solution 2
The recursive binary search process for finding the number 100 in the array proceeds as follows:

Step 1: Check middle index 4 (value = 50)

100 is greater than 50, so search the right half.
Step 2: Check middle index 7 (value = 65)

100 is greater than 65, so search the right half.
Step 3: Check middle index 8 (value = 70)

100 is greater than 70, so search the right half.
Step 4: Check middle index 9 (value = 100)

100 is found at index 9.
